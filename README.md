<!-- * Describe your project. What is it called? What does it do? Why did you make this web application? Who will benefit from using your web application? Describe your users - who are they? (anyone? or specific target age group or gender? region? country?) -->


In this project, we aim to build a web-based one-stop portal for all anime lovers to get their dose of the best and trending anime. Users are offered a personalized list of anime based on their favourite genre. Adding an aspect of sociability, users are able to add friends and get a feed of their latest status. Much like twitter, users can post a short status update that will show up on their friendâ€™s feed.
